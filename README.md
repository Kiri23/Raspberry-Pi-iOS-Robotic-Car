# Raspberry-Pi-iOS-Robotic-Car
# From Raspberry Pi to Advanced AI: A Software Developer's Journey

## Introduction

This repository documents my evolution as a software developer, beginning with a Raspberry Pi robotic car project and progressing to advanced explorations in artificial intelligence and machine learning. It showcases the diverse projects and skills acquired throughout this journey, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and practical application of emerging technologies.

## Initial Project: Raspberry Pi Controlled Robotic Vehicle

The journey began with the development of a robotic vehicle controlled by a Raspberry Pi. This project provided foundational experience in:
