# Raspberry-Pi-iOS-Robotic-Car
This is a Repository for my Raspberry Pi robotic car Project with pyFirebase(Python Wrapper class for Firebase) as the Backend and in the client side is a iOS app connected with Firebase to sent events

I initiated this project out of my passion for combining electronics with programming. The goal was to construct a small car controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which I could operate using an iPad. This hands-on project allowed me to apply my coding skills to create a tangible, interactive device.
